# GitHub Repository: Sample Project

This repository contains a simple web project consisting of three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The project is a basic HTML web page with a navigation menu and three content pages. The navigation menu is interactive and expands on hover, revealing hidden navigation blocks.

## Files

1. `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the web page. It includes a navigation menu with a central menu button (`nav-menu`) and hidden navigation blocks (`nav-block`). Additionally, there are three content sections (`page1`, `page2`, and `page3`) that will be displayed based on the user's navigation selection.

2. `style.css`: The CSS file provides styling for the HTML elements. It defines the appearance of the navigation menu and its animations, as well as the layout and colors for the content pages.

3. `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains a simple function to handle click events on the navigation menu (`nav-menu`). When a `nav-menu` is clicked, it triggers the `displayDate` function, which logs "Function working" to the console.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/thisizaro/htmlExpBlg1.git
```

After cloning, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the web page. The navigation menu will display on the left side, and clicking the central menu button will expand the hidden navigation blocks.

Feel free to modify and customize the code as per your requirements. This project serves as a starting point for building more complex web applications or experimenting with CSS animations.
